GoWiki
=======

This is a sample go web app based on the offical [wiki](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) example. 


The project uses [GB](http://getgb.io/) as the build tool, as an attempt to learn how it works. You can also use the default go build tool, but make sure to set GOPATH before you build.
